<h3>Installation of Taxsim35</h3>

The staticly linked taxsim35 AMD64 binary executable file is available at 
one of these URLs:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://taxsim.nber.org/taxsim35/taxsim35-windows.exe">
   http://taxsim.nber.org/stata/taxsim35/taxsim35-windows.exe</a>
<li><a href="https://taxsim.nber.org/stata/taxsim35/taxsim35-osx.exe">
   http://taxsim.nber.org/stata/taxsim35/taxsim35-osx.exe</a>
<li><a href="https://taxsim.nber.org/stata/taxsim35/taxsim35-unix.exe">
   http://taxsim.nber.org/stata/taxsim35/taxsim35-unix.exe (Linux)</a>
<li><a 
href="https://taxsim.nber.org/stata/taxsim35/taxsim.wasm">
   http://taxsim.nber.org/stata/taxsim35/taxsim.wasm 
(Linux)</a>

</ul>

Download the file and copy it to someplace on your system, 
perhaps in the default executable path for convenience. You 
should rename it taxsim35.exe to correspond to the example 
below but other name changes may cause problems..

<h4>Testing</h4>

Prepare a simple ASCII test file in csv format - we will call it 
txpydata.raw:

<xmp>
taxsimid,mstat,year,ltcg
1,2,1970,100000
</xmp>

and submit it to taxsim35.exe:

<xmp>
taxsim35.exe <txpydata.raw
</xmp>

You should receive a 2-line csv file in reply. If not, check the existence 
and permissions (Linux and OSX) on the executable file. 

<p>
For taxsim.wasm the command would be:

<xmp>
cat txpydata.raw | node -e "requires(taxsim.js)"
</xmp>

<h4>Format of submissions</h4>

taxsim35 expects to read a csv file with taxpayer data. The first row will 
be the variable names as documented at <a 
href="http://taxsim.nber.org/taxsim35"> 
href="http://taxsim.nber.org/taxsim35 </a> and each of the remaining rows 
corresponds to a tax return. <p>In addition to the taxpayer characteristic 
variables, variable <b>mtr</b>

<h4>Additional Controls</h4>

If the default marginal tax rate calculation or level of detail is not
to your liking, it is possible to change either with additiona variables. A

<p>These values of <b>mtr</b> affect the marginal tax calculation are:

<ul>
<li>11 - Wages
<li>70 - Long term capital gains
<li>85 - Primary wage earner
<li>86 - Secondary wage earner
</ul>

<p>
These values of <b>idtl</b> affect the output level:

<ul>
<li>0 - standard
<li>2 - full
<li>5 - with text description
</ul>

<p>For example descriptive output with several different marginal tax rates:
<xmp>
taxsimid,mstat,year,ltcg,mtr,idtl
1,2,1970,100000,11,5
1,2,1970,100000,70,5
1,2,1970,100000,85,5
1,2,1970,100000,86,5
</xmp>

<h4>Problems</h4>

The most likely problem is:

<xmp>
taxsim35: not found
</xmp>

or something similar. Other problems would be non-decimal characters in 
the data (such as missing value codes) or non-ascii data. Check your data 
in notepad or similar. If there are data problems, an explicit error 
message will be output to the standard output and execution will cease.

<h4>Source Code</h4>

Unlike the programs of professional programmers, taxsim35.for has no 
dependencies, uses no non-standard libraries and will compile on any 
computer with a fortran compiler with a single command:

<xmp>
gfortran taxsim35.for -o taxsim35.exe
</xmp>

If you need source code I can supply that. It is a single f90 file, and 
only 2 lines need changing for f77. In that case your compiler will 
complain about f0.2 and i0 format specifiers. Just change the 0 to 14 for 
pure f77 code.
