Hi! I am a postdoctoral fellow with the Stanford Initiative for Business, Taxation, and Society (Stanford GSB) and the California Policy Research Initiative (SIEPR) for the academic year 2024-2025. In fall 2025, I will join the Department of Economics at the University of Southern California as an assistant professor.

I study macroeconomics and public finance. I have broad research interests in the real effects of fiscal and monetary policy.

I received a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 2024, and a BA in economics and mathematics from Swarthmore College in 2014.

You can contact me by email at [mdroste@stanford.edu](mailto:mdroste@stanford.edu).
