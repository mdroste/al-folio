Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Harvard University.

I study macroeconomics and public finance. I have broad research interests in the real effects of fiscal and monetary policy.

I will be a postdoctoral fellow with the Stanford Initiative for Business, Taxation, and Society for the academic year 2024-2025. In fall 2025, I will begin as an assistant professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Southern California. 

You can contact me by email at [mdroste@fas.harvard.edu](mailto:mdroste@fas.harvard.edu).
