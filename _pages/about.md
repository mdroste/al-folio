Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Harvard University.

I study macroeconomics and public finance. I have broad research interests in the real effects of fiscal and monetary policy, with a particular focus on labor markets.

I am on the 2023-2024 economics job market. I would be delighted to speak with you about my research! You can find more information about my job market paper on my [job market webpage](/jobmarket). 

You can contact me by email at [mdroste@fas.harvard.edu](mailto:mdroste@fas.harvard.edu).
