I am on the economics job market for the 2023-2024 cycle. 

My paper and updated curriculum vitae will be available at this URL on November 2nd.

### Abstract
This paper studies strategic complementarity in posted wages in the United States. I develop a reduced-form empirical design to estimate the elasticity of firms' posted wages with respect to the average wage of their competitors. Using the near-universe of online job postings over the period 2010-2023, my estimates suggest this elasticity is between 0.05 and 0.15. Next, I interpret my empirical results through the lens of a monopsonistic New Keynesian model. In this model, wage-setting complementarities can arise through non-constant markdowns or non-constant returns to scale, and are inversely proportional to labor market power. This setting flexibly captures many mechanisms that generate strategic complementarity in wage-setting in a broad class of existing macroeconomic frameworks. Although wage-setting complementarities are a powerful source of real rigidity in this model, my empirical estimates suggest a starkly lower degree of complementarity than is commonly assumed in imperfectly competitive labor marakets. My estimates therefore provide an important "portable moment" to discipline the calibration of models with imperfectly competitive labor markets, and provide a new tool to measure strategic complementarities in other price-setting environments with observational data.
