I am on the economics job market for the 2023-2024 cycle. 

My job market paper studies strategic complementarity in posted wages in the United States. I develop a reduced-form exposure-based empirical design to estimate the elasticity of firms' posted wages with respect to the average wage of their competitors. Using the near-universe of online job postings over the period 2010-2023, I document that the average elasticity of posted wages is between 0.05 and 0.15. Next, I interpret my empirical estimates through the lens of a monopsonistic New Keynesian model. In this model, wage-setting complementarities can arise through non-constant markdowns or non-constant returns to scale, and are inversely proportional to labor market power. This setting flexibly captures the mechanisms that give rise to wage-setting complementarity in a broad class of imperfectly competitive labor markets. Although wage-setting complementarities are potentially a powerful source of real rigidity in my model, my empirical estimates suggest a starkly lower degree of complementarity than is commonly assumed in existing macroeconomic models with wage-setting complementarities. In turn, my estimates provide an important "portable moment" to discipline the calibration of models with imperfectly competitive labor markets, and provide a new tool to measure strategic complementarities in other price-setting environments with observational data. 

My paper and updated curriculum vitae will be available at this URL on November 2nd.
