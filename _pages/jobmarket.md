### Job Market Paper

This paper studies strategic complementarity in the wage-posting decision of firms. I begin by developing a reduced-form empirical design to estimate the elasticity of firms' posted wages with respect to the average wage of their competitors. My exposure-based design leverages spatial variation in the density of national wage setters, firms that do not vary wages across local labor markets, as a source of differential exposure to aggregate shocks. Using the near-universe of online U.S. job postings from 2010-2023, I estimate that the average elasticity of posted wages with respect to competitors' wages is between 0.05 and 0.15. I interpret the macroeconomic relevance of my empirical findings through the lens of a New Keynesian model with monopsonistic labor markets. In this model, wage-setting complementarities arise through non-constant markdowns or decreasing returns to scale, flexibly capturing the sources of wage-setting complementarity in a broad class of existing macroeconomic frameworks. Although wage-setting complementarities can act as a powerful source of real rigidity in my model, my estimates suggest a starkly lower degree of wage-setting complementarity than is commonly assumed in existing work. My estimates provide an important "portable moment" to discipline the calibration of models with imperfectly competitive labor markets, and provide a new tool to measure strategic complementarities in other price-setting environments with observational data. 

Draft available shortly!
