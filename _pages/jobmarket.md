### Job Market Paper

**Abstract**: Imperfectly competitive labor markets often exhibit strategic complementarity in wage-setting: wage-setting depends positively on the wages set by other agents. How important is this mechanism for macroeconomic dynamics? I develop a reduced-form empirical design to estimate the magnitude of strategic complementarity in posted wages using the near-universe of online job postings from 2010 to 2023. My design leverages spatial variation in exposure to \textit{national wage-setters}, firms that do not vary posted wages across local labor markets, as a source of differential exposure to aggregate shocks. My preferred estimates indicate a modest degree of complementarity in posted wages: posted wages increase by 0.10\% in response to a 1\% increase in competitors' wages. I assess the quantitative relevance of these results through the lens of a New Keynesian model with monopsonistic labor markets. Wage complementarities are a powerful source of real rigidity in this model; however, my empirical evidence suggests the effect of this channel is limited. My results suggest that the degree of strategic complementarity in wages is lower than many models implicitly assume, and provide an important portable moment to discipline models with imperfectly competitive labor markets.
