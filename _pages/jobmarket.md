I am on the economics job market for the 2023-2024 cycle. 

My paper and updated curriculum vitae will be available at this URL on November 2nd.

### Abstract
This paper studies strategic complementarity in posted wages in the United States. I develop a reduced-form empirical design to estimate the elasticity of firms' posted wages with respect to the average wage of their competitors. Using the near-universe of online job postings over the period 2010-2023, my estimates suggest this elasticity is between 0.05 and 0.15. Next, I interpret my empirical results through the lens of a New Keynesian model with monopsonistic labor markets. In this model, wage-setting complementarities arise through non-constant markdowns or decreasing returns to scale, flexibly capturing the sources of wage-setting complementarity in a broad class of existing models. Although wage-setting complementarity can act as a powerful source of real rigidity in my model, my empirical estimates suggest a starkly lower degree of wage-setting complementarity than is commonly assumed in macroeconomic models with imperfectly competitive labor markets. My estimates provide an important "portable moment" to discipline the calibration of models with imperfectly competitive labor markets, and provide a new tool to measure strategic complementarities in other price-setting environments with observational data.
